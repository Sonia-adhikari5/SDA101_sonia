# Practical 7 — SDA101: Tailwind Mini Project

## Overview
This practical focused on creating a responsive web page using **TailwindCSS**, a utility-first CSS framework. The project combines multiple layout and design concepts learned in SDA101, such as:

1. **Navigation Bar**  
   - Built with Flexbox utilities in Tailwind.
   - Includes links to Home, Courses, and Apply sections.
   - Features a responsive menu for mobile devices with a toggle button.

2. **Job Listings Table**  
   - Displays job opportunities with columns: Job Title, Company, Location, and Application Deadline.
   - Styled with Tailwind table classes for a clean and readable design.

3. **Photo Gallery**  
   - Uses Tailwind’s Grid utilities to create a responsive gallery.
   - Adapts from a single column on mobile, to 2 columns on medium screens, and 3 columns on large screens.
   - Each image has hover effects and smooth transitions.

4. **Buttons and Interactions**  
   - “Apply Now” button demonstrates hover transformations using Tailwind transitions.
   - Micro-interactions like scale and color changes enhance user experience.

5. **Responsive Design**  
   - Fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
   - Utilized Tailwind’s responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to control layout behavior at different breakpoints.
