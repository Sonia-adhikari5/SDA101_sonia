# Reflection on Practical 4 — Tables and Lists

This practical gave me hands-on experience in designing structured webpages using HTML tables, lists, and CSS styling. The main focus was on presenting data clearly and improving the visual appeal of web content.

## New Skills and Knowledge Acquired

Through this assignment, I learned how to structure data using tables, including headers, rows, and cells. I understood the importance of semantic markup in making the table readable and accessible. Working with tables helped me see how complex information, like grades or scores, can be organized in a straightforward manner.

I also gained practical experience in creating ordered and unordered lists for events. This included nesting lists to display additional details such as time and location. By combining ordered and unordered lists, I could maintain a clear hierarchy of information, which is crucial for readability.

The CSS styling portion taught me several new concepts:

Using hover effects to make lists interactive and user-friendly.

Implementing box-shadow and border-radius to give elements a modern, card-like appearance.

Applying custom counters to ordered lists for unique numbering.

Controlling spacing and alignment to ensure a clean layout using padding and margins.

These techniques significantly improved the webpage's aesthetics and demonstrated how CSS can enhance usability and engagement.

## Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome

One challenge I faced was ensuring consistent spacing and alignment between table cells and list items. At first, some content looked cluttered and misaligned. To solve this, I experimented with CSS properties like padding, margin, and border-collapse for tables.

Another challenge was styling nested lists for event details. Initially, the bullet points appeared confusing or misaligned. Using CSS, I removed default list styling, applied padding adjustments, and added custom markers to improve clarity and visual hierarchy.

Additionally, creating hover effects that worked smoothly across all events required careful testing. I overcame this by applying CSS transitions and ensuring consistent color contrasts, which enhanced both functionality and design.

## Overall Reflection

Practical 4 provided an excellent opportunity to combine HTML and CSS skills for practical webpage design. By working with tables, lists, and interactive styling, I gained a deeper appreciation of how data and events can be presented effectively on a website.

The assignment also highlighted the importance of visual hierarchy, spacing, and readability, all of which are key aspects of modern web design. Overcoming challenges such as nested list styling and spacing inconsistencies strengthened my problem-solving skills and attention to detail.

## Future Goals

In future projects, I plan to:

Explore responsive design techniques to ensure tables and lists display correctly on all devices.

Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for more sophisticated layouts.

Incorporate dynamic elements like collapsible lists, tooltips, or interactive tables using JavaScript.

Focus on accessibility, ensuring that tables and lists are readable by screen readers.

This practical laid a solid foundation for creating well-structured, visually engaging webpages and prepared me for more advanced web development projects.
