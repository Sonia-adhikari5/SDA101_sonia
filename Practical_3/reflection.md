# Reflection.md — Practical 3 SDA
Reflection on Creating My Student Profile Webpage

This practical gave me hands-on experience in combining HTML structure with CSS styling to produce a fully functional personal webpage. The main focus was on content organization, styling elements for visual appeal, and implementing basic layout principles.

## New Skills and Knowledge Acquired

Through this project, I learned how to structure content hierarchically using headings (h1, h2, h3, h4) and how to organize paragraphs and lists effectively. Working with both ordered and unordered lists taught me how to present information logically, such as my class schedule and daily to-do list.

I gained practical experience in integrating images into a webpage to make it more visually appealing. This included learning how to size images, add alternate text for accessibility, and position them within the layout.

On the CSS side, I explored the box model, understanding how padding, margin, border, and width interact to affect the size and spacing of elements. Implementing this on div containers helped me see how content can be grouped visually and spaced effectively.

I also learned how to use CSS to enhance aesthetics by changing colors, applying transparency, and rounding borders. These small design choices contributed to a more polished and professional look.

Another valuable takeaway was practicing layout design using div containers, which taught me the fundamentals of grouping content and arranging elements horizontally or vertically. This skill is essential for creating more complex web designs in the future.

## Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome

One challenge I encountered was ensuring proper alignment and spacing of different elements on the page. For instance, combining text, images, and lists in a visually balanced way required careful adjustments of margins and padding. To overcome this, I experimented with different CSS properties and used trial-and-error to achieve the desired layout.

Another challenge was avoiding redundancy in HTML, such as using multiple headings inside paragraph tags. Initially, this caused inconsistent spacing and formatting issues. I resolved this by restructuring the HTML to follow semantic best practices and applied classes for repeated styling instead of inline tags.

Additionally, designing the box model and layout sections required understanding how borders, padding, and margins interact. At first, the elements did not align as expected, but by systematically adjusting each property and using a browser preview, I was able to achieve the intended layout.

## Overall Reflection

This practical was an excellent introduction to the fundamentals of web design. It reinforced the importance of semantic HTML, consistent styling, and effective layout principles. By building a personal webpage, I learned how to combine text, images, lists, and styling in a cohesive way that communicates information clearly while maintaining visual appeal.

The process of overcoming challenges, such as element alignment and layout consistency, strengthened my problem-solving skills and attention to detail. I also developed confidence in using Figma-like planning techniques (mentally or on paper) to visualize webpage layouts before coding.

## Future Goals

In future projects, I plan to:

Explore responsive design to ensure webpages display correctly on all devices.

Learn CSS Flexbox and Grid to create more complex and adaptable layouts.

Integrate interactive elements such as buttons, hover effects, and dynamic content.

Optimize accessibility and semantic structure to improve usability for all users.

This practical laid the groundwork for more advanced web development tasks and gave me confidence in designing and building structured, visually engaging web pages.
