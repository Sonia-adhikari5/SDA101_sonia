# Reflection on Practical 6 — Personal Portfolio Website

This practical focused on building a responsive personal portfolio website using modern CSS techniques. It was an engaging and insightful task that allowed me to apply both Flexbox and CSS Grid in real-world scenarios.

## New Skills and Knowledge Acquired

Learned to structure multi-section webpages with semantic HTML elements for better accessibility and organization.

Gained proficiency in Flexbox for aligning navigation menus, social links, and skill cards efficiently.

Used CSS Grid to control the layout of main content sections and portfolio gallery for consistent spacing and alignment.

Enhanced my understanding of responsive design principles, ensuring the website adapts gracefully to smaller screens and mobile devices.

Practiced hover effects and transitions for interactive UI elements, such as skill cards and project cards, improving user engagement.

Explored modern CSS styling techniques, including gradients, shadows, border-radius, and flexible sizing using minmax() for grid columns.

This practical helped me see how layout design choices impact user experience and visual hierarchy. I also understood the importance of keeping a consistent color palette and typography across the webpage for a professional look.

## Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome

One challenge was combining Flexbox and Grid layouts effectively. Initially, some elements didn’t align properly, causing uneven spacing in the navigation bar and skill cards. To solve this, I carefully adjusted the justify-content, align-items, and flex-wrap properties in Flexbox and verified grid-template-areas for Grid layout.

Another challenge was responsive behavior on mobile devices. Skills and portfolio cards initially overflowed or became too narrow. Using flex-wrap: wrap for Flexbox and auto-fit/minmax for CSS Grid allowed content to adjust dynamically across screen sizes.

Finally, ensuring a visually appealing design required experimenting with shadows, border-radius, and color schemes. Iterative testing on both desktop and mobile views helped refine the aesthetics.

## Overall Reflection

Practical 6 was a highly rewarding exercise that reinforced my understanding of layout design, responsiveness, and UI aesthetics. I feel confident in creating:

Multi-section webpages using HTML, Flexbox, and CSS Grid.

Responsive layouts that work across various screen sizes.

Interactive and visually engaging UI elements with hover effects and transitions.

This practical strengthened my frontend development skills, particularly in crafting professional portfolios that are functional, visually appealing, and user-friendly.

## Future Goals

Implement JavaScript interactivity for dynamic content and animations.

Explore CSS variables and advanced Grid techniques for more complex layouts.

Connect portfolio to backend services for dynamic project content.

Enhance accessibility, ensuring ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation are fully supported.

Overall, this practical gave me valuable experience in building professional, responsive websites using modern web design techniques.
