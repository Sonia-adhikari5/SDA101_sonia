# Practical 8 — SDA101: DOM Manipulation Practice

## Overview
In Practical 8, the focus was on **JavaScript DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation**. The exercise allowed me to interact dynamically with HTML elements, update content, and respond to user actions. The main tasks included:

1. **Selecting Elements**  
   - Used `getElementById` to access single elements.  
   - Used `getElementsByClassName` to access multiple elements.  
   - Explored parent and child relationships of elements using `.parentElement`, `.children`, and `.firstElementChild`.

2. **Modifying Elements**  
   - Updated the text content of headings and paragraphs using `.textContent`.  
   - Changed styles dynamically, such as changing paragraph text color.

3. **Creating and Removing Elements**  
   - Added new paragraphs dynamically with `document.createElement` and `appendChild`.  
   - Removed the last paragraph from a container using `removeChild`.

4. **Event Handling**  
   - Added click event listeners to buttons for interactive behavior.  
   - Buttons allowed users to change the title text, add new elements, and remove the last element dynamically.
