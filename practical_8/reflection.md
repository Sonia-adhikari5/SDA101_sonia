# Reflection on Practical 8

## New Skills or Knowledge Acquired
Practical 8 gave me a deeper understanding of **DOM manipulation with JavaScript**, which is an essential skill for creating interactive web applications. I learned how to select HTML elements in multiple ways and manipulate their content and style dynamically. Using methods like `getElementById` and `getElementsByClassName` helped me understand how to target specific elements efficiently.

I also learned to explore the **DOM hierarchy**, accessing parent and child elements. This made it clear how elements are nested within each other and how I can traverse the DOM to perform complex operations.

Another major takeaway was learning to **dynamically create and remove elements**. This allowed me to understand how web pages can respond to user interactions without reloading. I learned to create new elements, assign classes, and append them to a container, as well as safely remove elements without affecting other parts of the page.

Event handling was another critical aspect. Adding `click` events to buttons demonstrated how user actions can trigger JavaScript functions, enabling real-time interactivity. This exercise reinforced the importance of listening for events and executing proper DOM updates.

## Challenges Faced
One of the main challenges I encountered was ensuring that dynamically added elements had the correct styling and behavior. I needed to remember to add appropriate classes and test the effects of new elements.

Another challenge was handling the removal of elements safely. Initially, I attempted to remove elements without checking the tag type, which caused unintended behavior. I solved this by adding a check to ensure only paragraph elements were removed, which made the function robust.

## How I Overcame These Challenges
- I carefully read the documentation for DOM methods like `appendChild` and `removeChild`.  
- I used `console.log` statements to debug and verify which elements were being targeted and manipulated.  
- I tested each function incrementally to ensure that the interactivity worked as expected.

## Overall Reflection
This practical reinforced my understanding of the DOM and the power of JavaScript in making web pages interactive. I now feel more confident in creating web pages that respond to user actions, update content dynamically, and maintain proper structure.  

I also learned the importance of planning the hierarchy of HTML elements for easier manipulation and how to write clean, efficient code that interacts seamlessly with the DOM. Practical 8 was a very rewarding exercise that bridged the gap between static HTML pages and dynamic web applications.
